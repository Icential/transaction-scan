The TinyVMM model is good at predicting MNIST with a training and test accuracy of 98%
However it is more mediocre in EMNIST with an accuracy of 80% in the test set
It is even more mediocre when put into an OCR
Therefore this model has bad generalization

The ResNet model very good at predicting MNIST with a training and test accuracy of 99%
In EMNIST it's average accuracy is 90%.
In an OCR, it's accuracy is better than TinyVMM however it takes twice as long
So use this model for accuracy but bad running time
